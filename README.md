## For this analysis, I chose citi bike data from Jersey City from the months of January and July in 2023. I thought it would be interesting to see the difference between the data in the middle winter and the middle of summer. Below I will describe the phenomena I looked at and my written analysis.

## The 2 Phenomena Analyzed:
### 1. The difference in popularity in stations and trip duration
### 2. Member Status and the difference in number of trips and trip duration

## Analysis
- Basic Map: When making this visualization, I noticed that there are stations more trips originate from than others. They must be in more populated areas than some of the other station locations.

- First, I chose to compare the stations popularity with the trip duration as I thought it might be interesting to see if the most popular stations resulted in the longest rides. The maps show the stations by trip duration via there dot size. In January, there are only a few stations that seem to be popular. However, in July there are many stations which show to be popular all over the city. Interestingly enough, in the bar charts the data shows that the most popular stations are not the ones resulting in the longest rides. They tend to be the semi-popular stations.

- Next, I chose to compare Member Status to station popularity and trip duration. Overall, it seems that the Top 10 Stations for each month show a much greater amount in members than casual riders using Citi Bikes. However when analyzing the trip duration, casual users show to have a higher average trip duration compared to members. This makes me think that the casual users might be using Citi Bikes as an alternative mode of transportation and not their first choice since they seems to be riding for a longer period of time.
