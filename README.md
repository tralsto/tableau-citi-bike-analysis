# tableau-citi-bike-analysis

### For this analysis, I chose citi bike data from Jersey City from the months of January and July in 2023. I thought it would be interesting to see the difference between the data in the middle winter and the middle of summer.

## The 2 Phenomena Analyzed:
### 1. The difference in popularity in stations and trip duration
### 2. Member Status and the difference in number of trips and trip duration
